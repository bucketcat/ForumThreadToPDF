# ForumThreadToPDF
A python script that functions as a webscraper, minus having to load the webpage which avoids accidental DoS and subsequent rate limitations, with the intent of saving large forum threads as PDF locally. Limited to forums that use sequential and nonencrypted URL's for page numbering.
